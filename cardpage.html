                        Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by
                        George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos.
                        The series follows several simultaneous plot lines. The first story arc follows a war of
                        succession among competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with
                        other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The second concerns the exiled
                        scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter,
                        as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North

                                he is a prominent point of view character. He is one of the most popular characters in
                                the series, and The New York Times cites him as one of the author's finest
                                creations.[1][2] Jon is a main character in the TV series, and his storyline in the
                                season 5 finale generated a strong reaction among viewers. Speculation about the
                                character's parentage has also been a popular topic of discussion among fans of both the
                                books and the TV series.
                                He appears briefly in A Feast for Crows (2005) and returns as a prominent character in A
                                Dance with Dragons (2011), in which he works to negotiate an alliance between the
                                Night's Watch and the wildlings against the Others; his policies are met with hostility
                                by some among the Watch, and he is assassinated in a mutiny at the novel's end.

                            Daenerys Targaryen is a fictional character in the series of epic fantasy novels A Song of
                            Ice and Fire by American author George R. R. Martin, and the television adaptation Game of
                            Thrones, in which English actress Emilia Clarke portrays her. In the novels, she is a
                            prominent point of view character. She is one of the series' most popular characters, and
                            The New York Times cites her as one of the author's finest creations.
                            In the story, Daenerys is in her early teens living in exile in Essos. She remains dependent
                            on her abusive older brother, Viserys, and is forced to marry Dothraki horselord Khal Drogo
                            in exchange for an army for Viserys, who wishes to return to Westeros and recapture the Iron
                            Throne. Daenerys adapts to life with the Dothraki, and her character emerges as strong,
                            confident and courageous. She becomes the heir of the Targaryen dynasty after her brother's
                            murder and plans to reclaim the Iron Throne herself, seeing it as her birthright. A pregnant
                            Daenerys loses her husband and child, but soon helps to hatch three dragons from their eggs.
                            The dragons provide her with a tactical advantage and prestige. She also acquires an army of
                            former slave soldiers with which she conquers the cities of Yunkai, Astapor and Meereen,
                            determined to end slavery and injustice. Despite her strong moral compass, she can deal
                            ruthlessly with her enemies, particularly slave masters. She establishes herself as a
                            powerful and relentless ruler.

                            Hugor Hill, is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of epic fantasy
                            novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of
                            Thrones, where he is portrayed by American actor Peter Dinklage. Introduced in A Game of
                            Thrones (1996), Tyrion is a prominent point of view character in the series, having the most
                            viewpoint chapters in the first five published novels. He is one of a few prominent
                            characters not included in A Feast for Crows (2005) but returned in A Dance with Dragons
                            (2011), and is confirmed to appear in the forthcoming sixth novel The Winds of Winter.[2][3]
                            Tyrion developed from a character concept Martin had while writing the 1981 novel
                            Windhaven.[4] He is Martin's favorite character in the series.

                            led the Night's Watch to commit atrocities.[4] Regarding whether the character in the
                            television series is the same as the one in the novels, Martin said, "As for the Night's
